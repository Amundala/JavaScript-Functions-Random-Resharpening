# JavaScript-Functions-Random-Resharpening

Hello Everybody, My name is Tom Amundala and I software developer who loves javascripts a lot.
So to keep my JS skills at top notch, I had a goal of always keeping rereading JS functions that
I come across with and at least perfom a small exercise on it.

Its fun for sho!,
